# 🕵️‍♂️ BOTSv1 Splunk Challenge — My Progress Log

Welcome to my little corner of investigation chaos 😄  
This repo tracks my journey through the **Splunk Boss of the SOC v1 (BOTSv1)** challenge — from initial setup to final flag!

---

## 📘 About BOTSv1

**Boss of the SOC (BOTS)** is a blue-team capture-the-flag challenge by Splunk.  
The goal: analyze security data in Splunk to answer questions about a simulated security incident.  

This is a hands-on way to level up threat hunting, detection, and analysis skills.

---

## 🚀 My Goals

- Learn how to navigate and query Splunk like a pro  
- Practice real-world investigation and incident response techniques  
- Document my process clearly enough for others (and future me)  
- Add this as a practical project in my security portfolio

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

A few early takeaways:
