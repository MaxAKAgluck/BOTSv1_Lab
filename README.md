# 🕵️‍♂️ BOTSv1 Splunk Challenge — My Progress Log

Welcome to my little corner of investigation chaos 😄  
This repo is for tracking my own journey through BOTSv1 Splunk challenge

Notes: 
1. I didn't want to download BOTS dataset on my own PC and go through the process of spinning up my own Splunk Enterprise instance. I used an online instance with dataset loaded already, see resources for links. 
2. I have almost no experience with such challenges and don't know advanced query language or tricks used by those regularly participating in such challenges.
3. I used hints provided with questions when I got stuck and verified my answers on this writeup: [Writeup](https://medium.com/@sabinaaliy3va/splunk-botsv1-writeup-47b73a2eadac)

## 📘 About BOTSv1

**Boss of the SOC (BOTS)** is a blue-team capture-the-flag challenge by Splunk.  
The goal: analyze security data in Splunk to answer questions about a simulated security incident.  

This is a hands-on way to level up threat hunting, detection, and analysis skills.

---

## 🚀 My Goals

- Learn how to navigate and query Splunk 
- Practice real-world investigation and incident response techniques  
- Document my process clearly enough for others (and future me)  
- Add this as a practical project in my security portfolio

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

A few early takeaways:
- Writing clear SPL queries is *half art, half science*  
- Investigations flow better when I tag interesting events early  
- Documentation saves sanity later on
